            "content": "I. . On August 15, 1995, Indians woke up to the tariff plan of a new sort of communication service. They could buy dial-up internet. . At Rs 15,000 a year, it was not quite something the average Indian could afford then. . I was still a young kid when I had a glimpse of the Internet1. The old dial-up connection tones, the slow speeds and hefty charges levied. But I was part of the generation that grew up with it’s evolving use cases. From simple search back then to entire generations who experience banking online and now even - digital factories. . The Internet’s effect has been phenomenal - on Economies and People. It has also been documented extensively. . So, why write about it now? . The qualitative side of it’s effect, is still unexplored. The beauty lies in the fact that every qualitative effect is intensely personal. . Thus, every qualitative effect is unique and worth exploring. . II. . Here is an excerpt I came across that can explain one of it’s effects : Digital Piracy - which has had a profound effect on me. . If someone were to claim that never before in the history of the world has anyone invented anything as useful as digital piracy, I wouldn’t feel compelled to disagree. Knowledge is power and power is, in a very real sense, life. The knowledge of any individual person has throughout human history been limited by three factors, and never before has any of them been less limiting than today. . Discovery. You can’t learn something that hasn’t been discovered yet. Einstein couldn’t have been Einstein if he’d been born in Biblical times. He needed the work of previous scientists to build upon. Similarly, you and I couldn’t know half the things we know if someone else hadn’t known them first and been able to teach us. The sum of human knowledge has been increasing at an accelerating rate for thousands of years and is today greater than it ever has been. | Technology. In order for you to learn something that’s already been discovered without having to discover it yourself, the knowledge has to find some conduit from the person who knows it to you. The technology for this has historically progressed in relatively sudden leaps. First, everything had to be taught in person and the transmission of knowledge was very limited. The invention of writing made a huge improvement to this. The invention of the printing press made another. Then radio, then TV, and most recently the internet. The ability we have today to turn on our computers and search for more information on any topic in the world we wish to learn about is quite possibly more revolutionary than any of that. Just 10 years ago, it would not have been possible for a single individual to independently build himself anywhere close to the kind of body of useful knowledge that it is today. Even if all the knowledge had been available somewhere, the time he would have had to spend looking for it would have limited his potential severely. Something that today takes 10 seconds to find out with the modern Google or Wikipedia could have taken minutes, hours or days in 2001. Aside from that, a lot of recently discovered knowledge that has proven to be very useful indeed just wasn’t available then. | Sharing. Since the dawn of time, people possessed of powerful secrets have made the rationally self-interested choice of keeping the secrets to themselves, or possibly selling them to a limited number of others in exchange for some sort of profit. Even in the internet age, Wikipedia won’t tell you the most valuable secrets that would really make a difference in your life. That kind of information is usually at a premium – in the internet age, it’s being sold as DVDs, eBooks and such for what are often considerable amounts of money. I’ve seen the prices of information products range anywhere from one dollar into the thousands. Someone wishing to learn a lot had to be seriously rich and willing to risk his money on a lot of things that might or might not turn out to be pig-in-a-poke scams – until widespread internet piracy came along and changed all that. Software piracy is as old as software itself, but not until recent years has it been possible for any random individual to go on the internet, do a quick search for a pirate copy of a relatively rare information product, actually find it, and download it onto his own computer within minutes. | III. . The biggest leeway the Internet has afforded me is in Exposure. . I grew up in India within the constraints of a middle-class family. It was still a time where access to knowledge would have been difficult. Until I discovered the Internet. . It enabled me to create an entire world - that I could immerse myself into. . As kids, we are usually handed a set of “responsibilities” along with an environment to carry them out in. Without much control over either - we experience the force of rules guiding us. Controlling everything - what we read, studied, thought and exposed to. . Without exposure to anything that challenges these rules and environment. . We grow up believing that this environment and its rules is world. . The Internet enabled exposure to things that challenged this environment. Without needing the approval of teachers or parents - I was in a sense free. . Free to read and think about things that challenged the rules and the environment I was brought up in. . That all along - what was hindering learning - was the very thing that advertised it - School. . And so many other such illusions were revealed. . This was liberating - I could for the first time - pursue things on my own terms, test my beliefs and learn new things on my own time and in a way that was unique fit for my context. . That was not all - it even enabled me to explore my interests. Seek out opportunities I never thought I would have been capable of acting upon. . IV. . The Internet has afforded me one of the longest levers of leverage - and I may be using a mere 10% of it. . The limits of what is possible, of how close to his desired ideal a man can shape his life, have undergone incredible expansion in the last few years and we still don’t know just where they’ve gone. The limits of possibility have expanded so fast that the actual people chasing them have not yet caught up . Footnotes . On a lighter watch a hilarious song dedicated to the Internet. &#8617; . |",

          "content": "Interesting excerpts I’ve come across. . Most people are discontented, but they generally tame it by finding something which gives them satisfaction, and then they function mechanically and go to seed, or they become bitter, cynical, and so on. Is that what you are after?….You condemn the state you are in; your mind is opposing it. Discontent is a flame that must be kept burning brightly, and not be smothered by some interest or activity that is pursued as a reaction from the pain of it. Discontent is painful only when it is resisted. A man who is merely satisfied, without understanding the full significance of discontent, is asleep; he is not sensitive to the whole movement of life. Satisfaction is a drug, and it is comparatively easy to find. But to understand the full significance of discontent, the search for certainty must cease. -The Flame of Discontent . You know, in biology there is a phenomenon called the sport, which is a sudden and spontaneous deviation from the type. If you have a garden and have cultivated a particular species of flower, one morning you may find that something totally new has come out of that species. That new thing is called the sport. Being new it stands out, and the gardener takes a special interest in it. And life is like that. The moment you venture out, something takes place in you and about you. Life comes to your aid in various ways. You may not like the form in which it comes to you - it may be misery, struggle, starvation - but when you invite life, things begin to happen. -Think on These Things . Side by side, Jeff and Sanjay took charge of this effort. Wayne Rosing, who had worked at Apple on the precursor to the Macintosh, joined Google in November, 2000, to run its hundred-person engineering team. “They were the leaders,” he said. Working ninety-hour weeks, they wrote code so that a single hard drive could fail without bringing down the entire system. They added checkpoints to the crawling process so that it could be re-started midstream. By developing new encoding and compression schemes, they effectively doubled the system’s capacity. They were relentless optimizers. When a car goes around a turn, more ground must be covered by the outside wheels; likewise, the outer edge of a spinning hard disk moves faster than the inner one. Google had moved the most frequently accessed data to the outside, so that bits could flow faster under the read-head, but had left the inner half empty; Jeff and Sanjay used the space to store preprocessed data for common search queries. Over four days in 2001, they proved that Google’s index could be stored using fast random-access memory instead of relatively slow hard drives; the discovery reshaped the company’s economics. Page and Brin knew that users would flock to a service that delivered answers instantly. The problem was that speed required computing power, and computing power cost money. Jeff and Sanjay threaded the needle with software. -The Friendship that made Google huge . Sir, life is very strange. The moment you are very clear about what you want to do, things happen. Life comes to your aid - a friend, a relation, a teacher, a grandmother, somebody helps you. But if you are afraid to try because your father may turn you out, then you are lost. Life never comes to the aid of those who merely yield to some demand out of fear. But if you say, “This is what I really want to do and I am going to pursue it”, then you will find that something miraculous takes place. You may have to go hungry, struggle to get through, but you will be a worthwhile human being, not a mere copy, and that is the miracle of it. -Think on These Things . But things were changing. The businesses were maturing, and like other companies, GE was learning that it could not win simply by launching increasingly sophisticated technologies or by taking existing technologies to new markets. Some of its best-thought-out new offerings were fast becoming commodities. Even executives within a business like Aviation were having trouble making sense of a rapidly changing industry. Fuel prices were volatile; demand was slowing; stronger regulatory oversight was around the corner. How could the business remain competitive and also prosper? “We didn’t really know how to translate what we knew about customers into the next growth idea,” Gentile admits. -Unleashing the Power of Marketing . I am not talking of proficiency through effort and struggle, but of the love of doing something. But don’t battle against society, don’t tackle dead tradition, unless you have this love in you, for your struggle will be meaningless, and you will merely create more mischief. Whereas, if you deeply feel what is right and can therefore stand alone, then your action born of love will have extraordinary significance, it will have vitality, beauty. You know, it is only in a very quiet mind that great things are born; and a quiet mind does not come about through effort, through control, through discipline. -Think on These Things . What would it be like to be the sole possessor of total, infinite absolute control?  At first it seems as though it would be akin to being a god, at least as gods are normally conceived to be.  But what would one’s life be like under such circumstances. Suddenly it hit like a bolt of lightning!  It would be death.  Absolute, perfect control is in the coffin. -Dee Hock . Enormous subjects are best approached in thin, deep slices. I discovered this when first learning how to program. The textbooks never worked; it all only started to click when I started to do little projects for myself. The project wasn’t just motivation but an organizing principle, a magnet to arrange the random iron filings I picked up along the way. I’d care to learn about some abstract concept, like “memoization,” because I needed it to solve my problem; and these concepts would lose their abstractness in the light of my example. Biology is no different. Learning begins with questions. How do embryos differentiate? Why are my eyes blue? How does a hamster turn cheese into muscle? Why does the coronavirus make some people much sicker than others? -I should have loved Biology . If you believe that water can be extracted from a stone, you will spend your entire life chiseling away at that stone. -Atmamun . The person who asks me How to do sometihng is not serious. He is simply looking for solace. He is looking for someone to sympathize with his plight. He is lookig for someone to tell him that it is Okay that he did not spend his life exploring and discovering the talents that nature bestowed upon him. -Atmamun . When I travel…I am watching how a society, an administration, is functioning. Why are they good?…And the ideas come from not just reading. You can read about it, but it is irrelevant if you do not relate it to yourself… which I constantly do…You must not overlook the importance of discussions with knowledgeable people. I would say that is much more productive than absorbing or running through masses of documents. Because in a short exchange, you can abstract from somebody who has immense knowledge and experience the essence of what he had gained. -The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew . The final corroboration of logic and reasoning comes when they become practical realities. The acid test is in performance, not promises. The millions of dispossessed in Asia care not and know not of theory. They want a better life. They want a more equal, just society. Good sense and good economics require that we must always find practical, not doctrinaire, solutions to our problems of growth and development. -The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew . What I want to discuss is the importance of simple, clear, written English. This is not simple…Arthur Koestler rightly pointed out that if Hitler’s speeches had been written, not spoken, the Germans would never have gone to war…When you send me or send your minister a minute or a memo, or a draft that has to be published like the president’s address, do not try to impress by big words. Impress by the clarity of your ideas…I speak as a practitioner. If I had not been able to reduce complex ideas into simple words and project them vividly for mass understanding, I would not be here today. -The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew . Every technological advance must be framed in a beguiling narrative if it’s to get off the workbench and into businesses or homes. These advances often are foreign concepts, after all, with potential that seems opaque if not daunting, so the job of a great marketer is to wrestle the concept back to earth and make it approachable for mere technophobic mortals. -Becoming Steve Jobs . “I watched Bob Dylan as I was growing up, and I watched him never stand still ,” Steve would tell me about a year later, in a circuitous attempt to explain why he finally dived back into Apple. “If you look at true artists, if they get really good at something, it occurs to them that they can do this for the rest of their lives, and they can be really successful at it to the outside world, but not really successful to themselves. That’s the moment that an artist really decides who he or she is. If they keep on risking failure they’re still artists. Dylan and Picasso were always risking failure. -Becoming Steve Jobs . Learning about new technologies and markets is what makes this fun for me and for everyone at Apple. -Becoming Steve Jobs . Developing a new interface is one of the most deceptively difficult technological challenges in computer science. It isn’t simply a matter of designing some delightful new way to present images of information on a computer. It’s just as much a matter of reckoning with—and not simply discarding—past habits. -Becoming Steve Jobs .",
