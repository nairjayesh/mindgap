    <p>Interesting excerpts I’ve come across.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know, in biology there is a phenomenon called the sport, which is a sudden and spontaneous deviation from the type. If you have a garden and have cultivated a particular species of flower, one morning you may find that something totally new has come out of that species. That new thing is called the sport. Being new it stands out, and the gardener takes a special interest in it. And life is like that. The moment you venture out, something takes place in you and about you. Life comes to your aid in various ways. You may not like the form in which it comes to you - it may be misery, struggle, starvation - but when you invite life, things begin to happen.  -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Think-These-Things-Jiddu-Krishnamurti-ebook/dp/B003P2WO90/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=think+on+these+things&amp;qid=1643184065&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=think+on+%2Cdigital-text%2C340&amp;sr=1-1">Think on These Things</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sir, life is very strange. The moment you are very clear about what you want to do, things happen. Life comes to your aid - a friend, a relation, a teacher, a grandmother, somebody helps you. But if you are afraid to try because your father may turn you out, then you are lost. Life never comes to the aid of those who merely yield to some demand out of fear. But if you say, “This is what I really want to do and I am going to pursue it”, then you will find that something miraculous takes place. You may have to go hungry, struggle to get through, but you will be a worthwhile human being, not a mere copy, and that is the miracle of it.   -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Think-These-Things-Jiddu-Krishnamurti-ebook/dp/B003P2WO90/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=think+on+these+things&amp;qid=1643184065&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=think+on+%2Cdigital-text%2C340&amp;sr=1-1">Think on These Things</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not talking of proficiency through effort and struggle, but of the love of doing something. But don’t battle against society, don’t tackle dead tradition, unless you have this love in you, for your struggle will be meaningless, and you will merely create more mischief. Whereas, if you deeply feel what is right and can therefore stand alone, then your action born of love will have extraordinary significance, it will have vitality, beauty. You know, it is only in a very quiet mind that great things are born; and a quiet mind does not come about through effort, through control, through discipline.    -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Think-These-Things-Jiddu-Krishnamurti-ebook/dp/B003P2WO90/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=think+on+these+things&amp;qid=1643184065&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=think+on+%2Cdigital-text%2C340&amp;sr=1-1">Think on These Things</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would it be like to be the sole possessor of total, infinite absolute control?  At first it seems as though it would be akin to being a god, at least as gods are normally conceived to be.  But what would one’s life be like under such circumstances. Suddenly it hit like a bolt of lightning!  It would be death.  Absolute, perfect control is in the coffin.   -<a href="http://www.deewhock.com/">Dee Hock</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enormous subjects are best approached in thin, deep slices. I discovered this when first learning how to program. The textbooks never worked; it all only started to click when I started to do little projects for myself. The project wasn’t just motivation but an organizing principle, a magnet to arrange the random iron filings I picked up along the way. I’d care to learn about some abstract concept, like “memoization,” because I needed it to solve my problem; and these concepts would lose their abstractness in the light of my example.
Biology is no different. Learning begins with questions. How do embryos differentiate? Why are my eyes blue? How does a hamster turn cheese into muscle? Why does the coronavirus make some people much sicker than others?  -<a href="https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/">I should have loved Biology</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you believe that water can be extracted from a stone, you will spend your entire life chiseling away at that stone.  -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Atmamun-Achieving-Himalayan-Swamis-Freedom-ebook/dp/B01EP72AO2">Atmamun</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The person who asks me How to do sometihng is not serious. He is simply looking for solace. He is looking for someone to sympathize with his plight. He is lookig for someone to tell him that it is Okay that he did not spend his life exploring and discovering the talents that nature bestowed upon him.  -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Atmamun-Achieving-Himalayan-Swamis-Freedom-ebook/dp/B01EP72AO2">Atmamun</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I travel…I am watching how a society, an administration, is functioning. Why are they good?…And the ideas come from not just reading. You can read about it, but it is irrelevant if you do not relate it to yourself… which I constantly do…You must not overlook the importance of discussions with knowledgeable people. I would say that is much more productive than absorbing or running through masses of documents. Because in a short exchange, you can abstract from somebody who has immense knowledge and experience the essence of what he had gained.  -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Wit-Wisdom-Lee-Kuan-Yew/dp/981438528X">The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final corroboration of logic and reasoning comes when they become practical realities.
The acid test is in performance, not promises. The millions of dispossessed in Asia care not and know not of theory. They want a better life. They want a more equal, just society. Good sense and good economics require that we must always find practical, not doctrinaire, solutions to our problems of growth and development. -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Wit-Wisdom-Lee-Kuan-Yew/dp/981438528X">The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I want to discuss is the importance of simple, clear, written English. This is not simple…Arthur Koestler rightly pointed out that if Hitler’s speeches had been written, not spoken, the Germans would never have gone to war…When you send me or send your minister a minute or a memo, or a draft that has to be published like the president’s address, do not try to impress by big words.
Impress by the clarity of your ideas…I speak as a practitioner. If I had not been able to reduce complex ideas into simple words and project them vividly for mass understanding, I would not be here today.   -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Wit-Wisdom-Lee-Kuan-Yew/dp/981438528X">The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every technological advance must be framed in a beguiling narrative if it’s to get off the workbench and into businesses or homes. These advances often are foreign concepts, after all, with potential that seems opaque if not daunting, so the job of a great marketer is to wrestle the concept back to earth and make it approachable for mere technophobic mortals. -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421">Becoming Steve Jobs</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I watched Bob Dylan as I was growing up, and I watched him never stand still ,” Steve would tell me about a year later, in a circuitous attempt to explain why he finally dived back into Apple. “If you look at true artists, if they get really good at something, it occurs to them that they can do this for the rest of their lives, and they can be really successful at it to the outside world, but not really successful to themselves. That’s the moment that an artist really decides who he or she is. If they keep on risking failure they’re still artists. Dylan and Picasso were always risking failure.  -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421">Becoming Steve Jobs</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning about new technologies and markets is what makes this fun for me and for everyone at Apple.   -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421">Becoming Steve Jobs</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developing a new interface is one of the most deceptively difficult technological challenges in computer science. It isn’t simply a matter of designing some delightful new way to present images of information on a computer. It’s just as much a matter of reckoning with—and not simply discarding—past habits.   -<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421">Becoming Steve Jobs</a></p>
