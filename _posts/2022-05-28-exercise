title: On Clarity: Part 1 - Exercise
---
Lately, I have been feeling pretty much exhausted waking up everyday and sometimes plain frustrated. I have lost interest in work and have clouded mind. 
This showed up in full force in the last week - which made me take a long pause and reflect. 

There is a new kind of challenge at work and I really wanted to understand it - but as always feel into 
I am working on a particularly interesting problem, details may or maynot be shared - lets use a code word: 500ttm. 

An observation revealed that there were some variables left uncontrolled namely - Sleep, Exercise and Food - and ofcourse a lot of others throughput the day. 

So, why bring up these?

Clarity does require a calm mind. I have found it that the moments when the most pain occurs - psychologically - there is movement required. 

The more intense the confusion and anxiety - the more intense is the exercise. 

It really stabilizes your mind. From there - begin!
