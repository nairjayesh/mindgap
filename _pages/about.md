Mind Gap was built as my home on the Internet. I truly want to explore topics that I think are "Gaps" in my "Mind", things that at the time are truly important to learn and write about. 
Majority of my time is spent on working in the [ndustry - 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution), at a startup. 
Feel free to reach out to me via below social media channels.
