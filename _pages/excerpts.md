Interesting excerpts I've come across.


>When I travel…I am watching how a society, an administration, is functioning. Why are they good?…And the ideas come from not just reading. You can read about it, but it is irrelevant if you do not relate it to yourself… which I constantly do…You must not overlook the importance of discussions
with knowledgeable people. I would say that is much more productive than absorbing or running through masses of documents. Because in a short exchange, you can abstract from somebody who has immense knowledge and experience the essence of what he had gained.  -[The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew](https://www.amazon.in/Wit-Wisdom-Lee-Kuan-Yew/dp/981438528X)

>The final corroboration of logic and reasoning comes when they become practical realities.
The acid test is in performance, not promises. The millions of dispossessed in Asia care not and know not of theory. They want a better life. They want a more equal, just society. Good sense and good economics require that we must always find practical, not doctrinaire, solutions to our problems of growth and development. -[The Wit and Wisdom of Lee Kuan Yew](https://www.amazon.in/Wit-Wisdom-Lee-Kuan-Yew/dp/981438528X)



>Every technological advance must be framed in a beguiling narrative if it’s to get off the workbench and into businesses or homes. These advances often are foreign concepts, after all, with potential that seems opaque if not daunting, so the job of a great marketer is to wrestle the concept back to earth and make it approachable for mere technophobic mortals. -[Becoming Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421)


>“I watched Bob Dylan as I was growing up, and I watched him never stand still ,” Steve would tell me about a year later, in a circuitous attempt to explain why he finally dived back into Apple. “If you look at true artists, if they get really good at something, it occurs to them that they can do this for the rest of their lives, and they can be really successful at it to the outside world, but not really successful to themselves. That’s the moment that an artist really decides who he or she is. If they keep on risking failure they’re still artists. Dylan and Picasso were always risking failure.  -[Becoming Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421)


>Learning about new technologies and markets is what makes this fun for me and for everyone at Apple.   -[Becoming Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421)


>Developing a new interface is one of the most deceptively difficult technological challenges in computer science. It isn’t simply a matter of designing some delightful new way to present images of information on a computer. It’s just as much a matter of reckoning with—and not simply discarding—past habits.   -[Becoming Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347421)
